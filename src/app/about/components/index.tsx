        My goal is to release one new &quot;thing&quot; every week. For this first week the &quot;thing&quot;
        is the website itself. I plan on having a responsive design, basic layout with navigation,
        and light/dark theme togglable. I will use Material UI (MUI) and create-react-app, though
        in the future I may use other frameworks or libraries like Next.js/Nuxt.js, Vue, Svelte,
        Angular, etc.

        <br/>
        As I come up with more ideas and organize them, I&apos;ll populate a list here (or somewhere else on the site, we&apos;ll see!)
      </body>
    </>
